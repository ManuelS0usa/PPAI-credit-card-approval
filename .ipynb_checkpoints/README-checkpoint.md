# Predict Credit Card Approval With Data Anonimization
## Privacy Preserving Artificial Intelligence Project | Manuel Sousa | 14.06.2022

### Goal: 
* Build an AI model that predict credit card approval using original and anonimized data;
* Compare AUC of models.

### Challenges
A risk of maximum 10% Prosecutor Risk and K-anonymity of 5.

### Context
A given insurance company in order to target credit card approval has a dataset to apply machine learning algorithms to predic approvals.

### Scripts & files
The following scripts were built in the scope of the development of this project:
* ccapproval_ppai.deid: dataset anonimization project file using ARX tool;
* original.ipynb: ML model training with original data;
* anonimization.ipynb: ML model training with anonymized data.
